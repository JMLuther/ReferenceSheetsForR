# Introduction  

This file is resource to help students get started with R.
This assumes that students are motivated (and intelligent!), but do not have any experience in programming, statistics, or medical research.


Each section is targeted based on your experience level in R and programming.

## Beginner  

**The Tidyverse**  

I'm convinced the best introductory R resource is [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), available either online (free) or in print.  This book is written by Hadley Wickham et al. and uses an R programming dialect which is in my opinion, more consistent than the standard "Base R" language which does not rely on any extra packages. I recommend learning this first, and then expanding your knowledge of the "Base R" language.  Note that anything that can be done using the "tidyverse" language can be done using Base R functions. However, for people with little programming background, this book is a great introduction.  

This book will walk you through it but here are the first steps:  

  1.  Install R from the [CRAN website](https://cloud.r-project.org/)  
  2.  Install RStudio from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)  
  3.  Start RStudio and install the `tidyverse` package with the code `install.packages("tidyverse")`  
  
**Stats 545**  

You can also start with the University of British Columbia [`STAT 545`](http://stat545.com/index.html) website, which has an incredible list of introductory material for R and Statistics. It is written largely by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) who you can follow on Twitter. The most useful [list of topics page](http://stat545.com/topics.html) will get you going.

**Standard/Base R**  

Another book with more focus on statistics is [Applied Statistics with R](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) which is an online book. This book is written with "Base R" in mind, rather than using the "tidyverse" dialect presented in **R for Data Science**  
Note: GitHub makes anything you load public. Do not upload sensitive research data here.  

## Intermediate  

## Advanced    

Once you have a good handle on the R language, you can expand on it using these references. Some are available online, although some are only in print.
