For step-by-step instructions see [Stats 545 "Happy Git with R"](http://happygitwithr.com/).
This assumes that you can successfully set up a GitHub connection in RStudio using the instructions.
The following lists the simplest steps which work for me (see [16.1 New Project, GitHub First](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)):

  1.  Make a new repo on GitHub  
      *  create with a README.md  
      *  Use the same name for the repo and RStudio Project  
  2.  Start a new Project in RStudio  
      *  New Project > Version Control > Git  
      *  Paste the url in the "repository url" 
  3.  Once the project is created, it should automatically pull in the "README.md" file from GitHub. That's how you know for sure it has connected.  
  4.  Within RStudio make some changes, save, and commit
